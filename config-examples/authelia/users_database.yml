# Authelia Users Database Configuration
# This file defines users when using the file-based authentication backend
# For production, use LDAP/Active Directory instead

# Password hashes can be generated using:
# authelia hash-password 'your-password'
# Or using argon2: echo 'password' | argon2 somesalt -e
