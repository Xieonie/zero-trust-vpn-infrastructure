# Notes:
# 1. Rules are processed in order - first match wins
# 2. Use specific rules before general ones
# 3. Always test access control changes in a staging environment
# 4. Monitor access logs for unauthorized attempts
# 5. Regularly review and update access control policies
# 6. Document the business justification for each rule
# 7. Implement the principle of least privilege
# 8. Use groups instead of individual users where possible
