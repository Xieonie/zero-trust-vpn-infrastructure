## Policy Overview

### Zero Trust Policy Principles

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every access request must be authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Users get minimum access required for their role
3. **Assume Breach**: Design policies assuming the network is already compromised
4. **Verify Explicitly**: Use all available data points for access decisions
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously validate security posture

## Best Practices

### Policy Design Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Grant minimum access required
   - Regular access reviews
   - Automatic access expiration

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security
   - Redundant controls
   - Fail-safe defaults

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Real-time policy evaluation
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Adaptive policies

4. **User Experience**
   - Minimize friction for legitimate users
   - Clear error messages
   - Self-service capabilities

5. **Compliance and Audit**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Regular compliance checks
   - Audit trail integrity

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with basic policies
   - Gradually add complexity
   - Monitor and adjust

2. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Simulate all scenarios
   - Validate with real users
   - Performance testing

3. **Document Everything**
   - Policy rationale
   - Implementation details
   - Troubleshooting guides

4. **Train Users**
   - Security awareness
   - Policy understanding
   - Incident reporting

5. **Regular Reviews**
   - Policy effectiveness
   - Security posture
   - Business alignment
