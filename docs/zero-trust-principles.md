# Zero Trust Security Principles

## Overview

Zero Trust is a security framework that requires all users, whether in or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated for security configuration and posture before being granted or keeping access to applications and data.

## Core Principles

### 1. Never Trust, Always Verify

**Traditional Approach:**
- Trust based on network location
- Implicit trust for internal users
- Perimeter-based security model

**Zero Trust Approach:**
- Verify every user and device
- Continuous authentication
- Context-aware access decisions

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Example: Continuous verification script
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    # Check device health
    check_device_compliance
    
    # Verify user session
    validate_user_session
    
    # Monitor network behavior
    analyze_traffic_patterns
    
    sleep 300  # Check every 5 minutes
done
```

### 2. Least Privilege Access

**Principles:**
- Grant minimum necessary access
- Time-limited permissions
- Regular access reviews
- Just-in-time access

**Access Control Matrix:**
```yaml
access_policies:
  guest_user:
    networks: ["dmz"]
    services: ["web", "email"]
    duration: "8h"
    
  employee:
    networks: ["internal", "dmz"]
    services: ["file_server", "web", "email", "print"]
    duration: "24h"
    
  administrator:
    networks: ["internal", "dmz", "secure"]
    services: ["all"]
    duration: "4h"
    mfa_required: true
```

### 3. Assume Breach

**Mindset:**
- Attackers are already inside
- Continuous monitoring required
- Rapid incident response
- Minimize blast radius

**Detection Strategies:**
- Behavioral analytics
- Anomaly detection
- Threat hunting
- Forensic capabilities

## Implementation Framework

   - Application-level controls

2. **Traffic Inspection**
   - Deep packet inspection
   - SSL/TLS decryption
   - Behavioral analysis

### Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring

## Policy Framework

### Authentication Policies
```yaml
authentication:
  primary_factor:
    type: "password"
    complexity: "high"
    rotation: "90d"
    
  secondary_factor:
    type: "totp"
    backup: "fido2"
    
  device_certificate:
    required: true
    validity: "1y"
    auto_renewal: true
```

### Authorization Policies
```yaml
authorization:
  default_deny: true
  
  rules:
    - name: "web_access"
      users: ["employees", "contractors"]
      resources: ["web_servers"]
      conditions:
        - time: "business_hours"
        - location: "trusted_networks"
        
    - name: "admin_access"
      users: ["administrators"]
      resources: ["all"]
      conditions:
        - mfa: "required"
        - approval: "manager"
        - session_timeout: "4h"
```

### Network Policies
```yaml
network:
  default_action: "deny"
  
  zones:
    dmz:
      trust_level: "low"
      monitoring: "enhanced"
      
    internal:
      trust_level: "medium"
      monitoring: "standard"
      
    secure:
      trust_level: "high"
      monitoring: "maximum"
```

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors
1. **User Risk**
   - Authentication failures
   - Unusual access patterns
   - Compromised credentials

2. **Device Risk**
   - Unmanaged devices
   - Outdated software
   - Suspicious behavior

3. **Network Risk**
   - Unusual traffic patterns
   - Known bad IPs
   - Protocol anomalies

### Risk Scoring
```python
def calculate_risk_score(user, device, network):
    base_score = 0
    
    # User risk factors
    if user.failed_logins > 3:
        base_score += 20
    if user.location_anomaly:
        base_score += 15
    if user.time_anomaly:
        base_score += 10
        
    # Device risk factors
    if not device.managed:
        base_score += 25
    if device.os_outdated:
        base_score += 15
    if device.malware_detected:
        base_score += 50
        
    # Network risk factors
    if network.suspicious_traffic:
        base_score += 30
    if network.known_bad_ip:
        base_score += 40
        
    return min(base_score, 100)
```

## Compliance Considerations

### Regulatory Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security
- **SOX**: Financial controls
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card security

### Audit Requirements
- **Access logs**: All authentication attempts
- **Authorization logs**: Permission grants/denials
- **Network logs**: Traffic flows and anomalies
- **System logs**: Configuration changes

## Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Start with Identity**
   - Implement strong authentication
   - Establish user directory
   - Deploy MFA everywhere

2. **Segment Networks**
   - Create security zones
   - Implement micro-segmentation
   - Monitor inter-zone traffic

3. **Monitor Everything**
   - Deploy comprehensive logging
   - Implement real-time monitoring
   - Establish incident response

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Trying to do everything at once**
   - Implement incrementally
   - Focus on high-risk areas first
   - Measure and adjust

2. **Ignoring user experience**
   - Balance security and usability
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Offer self-service options

3. **Insufficient monitoring**
   - Monitor all access attempts
   - Correlate events across systems
   - Automate response where possible
